# Document Similarity using Embeddings

## Description
This project demonstrates how to calculate semantic similarity between documents
using Hugging Face sentence-transformer embeddings and cosine similarity.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain
- HuggingFace Embeddings
- Scikit-learn

## How it Works
1. Documents are converted into embeddings
2. Query is embedded
3. Cosine similarity is used to find the most relevant document

## Output
- Most relevant document: "Virat Kohli is a famous Indian cricketer."
- Similarity score: ~0.89
